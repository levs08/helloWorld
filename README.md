From administrative assistant working for technical departments to joining the ranks of the development team, my drive to join in the creation process of educational software, video games, and utility applications has moved me through the last twenty years. I know what it takes to make management shine, and I know what it takes to make the team shine. That combined with the formal education and continued professional development, and what you have is an industrious team player who likes to work hard and play hard.
